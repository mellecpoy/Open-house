My motivation for coding comes from my curiosity about how technology works and my desire to create something meaningful through it. I see coding as a powerful skill that allows me to turn ideas into real, functional projects that can solve everyday problems. Every time I write code, I’m not just learning syntax—I’m learning how to think logically, solve problems creatively, and build things that can make a difference. I’m driven by the challenge of continuous learning, the satisfaction of fixing errors, and the excitement of seeing my work come to life on screen. Ultimately, coding gives me the opportunity to grow, innovate, and open doors to a future in technology.
