I decided to join a coding bootcamp because I want to build a strong foundation in software development and transition into a career in tech. I’ve always been interested in how technology works and how software can solve real-world problems. The bootcamp provides a structured learning path, hands-on projects, and mentorship that will help me develop practical skills faster. I’m motivated to challenge myself, learn new programming languages, and gain the confidence to create my own applications. This opportunity will bring me closer to achieving my goal of becoming a professional software developer and contributing to meaningful projects in the future
