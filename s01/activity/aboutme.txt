“My motivation for joining this bootcamp is to strengthen my technical skills and gain real-world experience in coding. I want to become more confident in solving problems, building projects, and preparing myself for future opportunities in the tech industry.”


During my time at Shangri-La The Fort Manila, I worked as part of the In-Room Dining Service team, where I provided exceptional service to guests by ensuring their dining experience was smooth, timely, and of the highest quality. My role involved taking and delivering guest orders, setting up in-room dining presentations, and maintaining excellent communication with the kitchen and front-of-house staff. Through this experience, I developed strong customer service, time management, and multitasking skills while upholding the hotel’s high standards of hospitality and professionalism.
